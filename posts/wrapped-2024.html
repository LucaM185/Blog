                                <strong>MuHack</strong> <br>
                                A very lucky event that happened in 2024. I was introduced to this group of Hackers in the university of Brescia. A fantastic group of people with all the key skills to build great things. Now i'm a part of this and i'm there every Tuesday.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Manim Studio</strong> <br>
                                First project of the year, plain html-css-js with a flask backend. A website to develop manim animation assisted by AI. this was from the era of GPT3.5, 4 and 4 turbo. I learnt a lot but utlimately determined that current LLMs are not good enough for manim generation unsupervised. I was showing this to everyone in the first days of MuHack.

                                <strong>Electric Motor</strong> <br>
                                Developed an almost-working 3d printed electric motor with plastic planetary gearbox with a custom made esc. This ultimately didn't work and was abandoned to work on RL. Great learning experience.

                                <strong>Work (interviews)</strong> <br>
                                Considered working for Apogeo Space and TwoBits. Cool companies, but i was interested in deep learning and didn't feel like they could help me out with that.

                                <strong>Deep Learning Saga</strong> <br>
                                - <strong>Reinforcement learning</strong> <br>
                                Started making a simulator with a tiny car going around a track. It was able to learn how to go thru Monza reliably with a dozen of "laser" like distance measurements and a MLP.
                                <br>
                                - <strong>GPTs-from-scratch</strong> <br>
                                Beautiful explanation of neural networks from scratch. It's on my GitHub. My best project, I'm very proud of it.
                                <br>
                                - <strong>Pigograd</strong> <br>
                                After studying tinygrad, I tried to build a small version of PyTorch myself. This works pretty well, the only import is numpy and it allows you to train models. Tested on MNIST with MLP, optimized by ADAM.
                                <br>
                                - <strong>YOLO</strong> <br>
                                Working on advanced OCR, tried many approaches, from E2E to yolo11 + transformer.

                                <strong>The Flutter Saga</strong> <br>
                                Started working on a bunch of Flutter apps with a friend:
                                <br>- A simple math app with small courses (stopped because the courses were time-consuming to write)
                                <br>- An advanced to-do list (did not feel fast or nice to use)
                                <br>- Working on an app with math completion on handwriting, like GitHub Copilot for handwriting (Apple has Math Notes which is similar)
                                <br>- Working on an app for note-taking and sharing on a board. Exploring synchronization over many devices with multiple databases and a server, working with it on SSH
                                <br>- Many tiny projects, small experiences app with Lorenzo Rozzini
                            </li>                        
                            <li>
                                <strong>Work</strong><br>
                                Considering a job at FixUp. The CEO offered me a position as a data scientist and basically i would have to manage a branch of the company for advanced research disconnected from the bureocracy of the legacy systems. This felt a lot like a skunk works and i'm genuinely excited.
